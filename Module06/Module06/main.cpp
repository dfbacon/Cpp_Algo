 Programming Problem #3
 Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++ 6th ed page 221
 
 Write a function that uses a stack to test whether a given string is a
    palindrome. Exercise 14 asked you to write an algorithm for such a function
 
 Use the STL library stack and see the note at the bottom of programming problem 1.
 
 Student Learning Objectives.
 Although this solution can be solved with simple looping - we want to demonstrate
    an understanding of stack structures to check for a palindrome. This is
    directly related to SLO #1: Predict the results of data structures, including
    lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, heaps, and hash tables, with associated
    algorithms such as insertion, deletion, retrieval, search, and traversal.
