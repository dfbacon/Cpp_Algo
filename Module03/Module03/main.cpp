 Programming Problem #1
 Data Abstraction and Problem Solving with C++ 6th ed page 115
 Design and implement an ADT that represents the time of day. Represent the time as hours and minutes on a 24-hour clock. The hours and minutes are the private data members of the class that implements the ADT. Include at least two initialization operations: one that provides a default value for the time, and another that sets the time to a client-supplied value. These operations are the classâ€™s constructors. Also include operations that set the time, increase the present time by a number of minutes, and display the time in 12-hour and 24-hour notations.
 
 Demonstrate your ADT in a main function.
 
 Student Learning Objectives.
 This is our first foray into developing an ADT. This has the advantage of being a simple ADT. This clearly relates to the SLO #3 "Design and implement data structures and algorithms, including array-based and linked list implementations," even though this solution does not require an array or linked list.
 Submission and Assessment
 To submit this assignment, use the submit button and submit (Links to an external site.) your .cpp file.
 You can expect to get a your assignment grade and feedback in one (1) week.
 Your assessment will be based on the assignment rubric (The rubric can be found at the bottom of the assignment page).
 Key topics  give you an idea of what are important aspects of the assignment. They are also used in conjunction with the grading rubric for assessing your grade . The best way to get a good grade is to make sure your assignment addresses all the key topics.
 Key Topics
 Input
 The ADT includes interfaces for set the time and increase the present time by a number of minutes.
 Users cannot impact non-interface members of the ADT.
 Processing
 The ADT handles various time related math (e.g. increasing time by 60 minutes increases the number of hours displayed by 1).
 Correct use of initialization and constructors.
 Output
 The ADT correctly handles different time displays ("display the time in 12-hour and 24-hour notations.")
